      <h2>Orientation Day</h2>
      <p>
        This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an
        opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one
        hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief
        overview of what to expect during the school year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see
        orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or
        Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group
        before the entire class attends on Friday.
