        We believe in learning through play; we provide fun, child-centered
        activities that effectively engage students. We encourage creativity in
        all areas with a special focus on the arts to enhance language and

        pleasure in learning, that they develop confidence in their ability to
        learn and to accomplish challenging tasks and that they gain experience
        and skills in interacting with others.

                I cannot say enough good things about WUNS. We feel extremely
                lucky to have discovered your nursery school. The staff is
                dedicated, well-trained and (most of all) cares deeply for the
                children. The other families are warm and welcoming, and their
                diversity will hopefully serve as a baseline for...what the
                world should look like.

                It’s wonderful to feel like your child’s caregivers are better
                at the job than you are; truly, on the whole they are more
                patient, better able to see the forest for the trees, certainly
                more trained and aware of what’s developmentally appropriate
                than I am.

                There are many benefits, but problem-solving and being a good
                friend are two of the important things our child is learning at
                WUNS. In small ways–through play, stories, outings, activities
                and pictures–there is so much learning taking place at WUNS
                (great for all abilities and learning styles). WUNS is a diverse
                environment with many opportunities to learn about other
                cultures, customs, foods and traditions that our (child) most
                likely wouldn’t have been exposed to elsewhere.
